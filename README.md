# Steps to Run the Project

## Setup

**First time**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NiteshTyagi/food_tracker.git
cd food_tracker/project
npm i --save-dev parcel
```

**Then you can run the server**

```bash
npm run-script serve
```

Browse to [localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234)

## Parcel

This starter uses parcel (v2) to bundle your scripts.

You can import other files. Make sure you have the correct path. You can also import libraries installed with NPM. We already included an example for you with **date-fns**. Feel free to remove it if you don't need it.

## Build for production

When you're ready to deploy, you can build for production with the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```
